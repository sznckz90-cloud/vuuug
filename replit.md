# Recent Changes

**October 25, 2025 - Replit Environment Setup & Multi-Account Prevention Fix**

*Replit Environment Setup:*
*   **GitHub Import Setup**: Successfully configured project for Replit environment
*   **Database**: Provisioned PostgreSQL database and ran migrations successfully
*   **SQL Fix**: Replaced SQL template literals with parameterized queries in `upsertTelegramUser` function
    - Changed from `db.execute(sql`...`)` to `pool.query(query, values)` with `$1, $2, ...` syntax
    - Prevents SQL syntax errors and improves security
*   **Development Workflow**: Configured workflow on port 5000 with `allowedHosts: true` for Replit proxy compatibility
*   **Deployment**: Set up autoscale deployment configuration for production

*Multi-Account Prevention Fix:*
*   **Issue**: Users could create multiple accounts from the same device despite one-account-per-device policy
*   **Root Cause**: `useAuth.ts` authentication function was not sending device headers (`x-device-id`, `x-device-fingerprint`)
*   **Fix Applied**: 
    - Updated `authenticateWithTelegram` in `useAuth.ts` to include device tracking headers
    - Device ID and fingerprint now sent with all Telegram authentication requests
    - Added error handling for banned accounts
*   **How It Works**:
    - Each device generates a unique ID stored in localStorage
    - Backend checks if device ID already has an associated account
    - If duplicate detected: new account is banned, primary account receives warning
*   **Testing**: Device validation only works in production with real Telegram users (development mode bypasses device checks)
*   **Status**: âœ… Fix verified by architect, ready for production testing
