    - Properly handles Telegram channels with `tg://resolve?domain=` format
    - Telegram bots open directly in Telegram app
    - External websites open in new browser tab
    - After successful completion, task is removed from feed
*   **Notification System**: 
    - All notifications (success, error, validation) now use AppNotification component
    - Replaced all toast() calls with showNotification() for consistency
    - Smooth animations on all user-facing messages
    - Validation errors for task creation and click additions now use AppNotification
*   **Testing**: All changes verified by architect, ready for production deployment
*   **Status**: ‚úÖ Complete UX overhaul verified, ready for production

**October 29, 2025 - Task Creation UI Updates & Database Fix**

*Task Creation System Improvements:*
*   **Database Fix**: Created missing `advertiser_tasks` and `task_clicks` tables in the database
*   **UI Updates**: 
    - Moved "+Task" button to top header (right side, next to "Set Wallet" button)
    - Removed "Cost Summary" section from task creation form
    - Updated submit button to show cost: "Pay X TON & Publish"
    - Removed emojis from notification messages
*   **Backend**: TON balance deduction logic already implemented in `/api/advertiser-tasks/create` endpoint (lines 3051-3056 in server/routes.ts)
*   **Migration**: Updated `server/migrate.ts` to automatically create task tables on future deployments
*   **Status**: ‚úÖ Task creation system is now fully functional

**October 28, 2025 - Broadcast Functionality Enhancement**

*Telegram Bot Broadcast Improvements:*
*   **Issue**: Admin broadcast messages used plain text links instead of interactive buttons
*   **Fix Applied**: 
    - Replaced plain text footer links with Telegram inline buttons in `server/telegram.ts`
    - "üöÄ Open App" button (web_app type) opens the application directly
    - "ü§ù Join Community" button (URL type) links to Telegram channel
    - Improved rate limiting with batched sending (25 messages/batch, 1 second pause between batches)
    - Maintains ~25 messages/second to stay within Telegram's 30 msg/s rate limit
*   **How It Works**:
    - Admin uses `/szxzyz` command to open admin panel
    - Clicks "üîî Announce" button to start broadcast
    - Types broadcast message (with "‚ùå Cancel Broadcast" option available)
    - Message is sent to all users with inline buttons
    - Deduplication ensures one message per unique telegram_id
    - Admin receives detailed summary: success count, failed count, skipped count
*   **Testing**: Requires TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN and TELEGRAM_ADMIN_ID environment variables
*   **Status**: ‚úÖ Verified by architect, ready for production use

**October 25, 2025 - Replit Environment Setup & Multi-Account Prevention Fix**

*Replit Environment Setup:*
*   **GitHub Import Setup**: Successfully configured project for Replit environment
*   **Database**: Provisioned PostgreSQL database and ran migrations successfully
*   **SQL Fix**: Replaced SQL template literals with parameterized queries in `upsertTelegramUser` function
    - Changed from `db.execute(sql`...`)` to `pool.query(query, values)` with `$1, $2, ...` syntax
    - Prevents SQL syntax errors and improves security
*   **Development Workflow**: Configured workflow on port 5000 with `allowedHosts: true` for Replit proxy compatibility
*   **Deployment**: Set up autoscale deployment configuration for production

*Multi-Account Prevention Fix:*
*   **Issue**: Users could create multiple accounts from the same device despite one-account-per-device policy
*   **Root Cause**: `useAuth.ts` authentication function was not sending device headers (`x-device-id`, `x-device-fingerprint`)
*   **Fix Applied**: 
    - Updated `authenticateWithTelegram` in `useAuth.ts` to include device tracking headers
    - Device ID and fingerprint now sent with all Telegram authentication requests
    - Added error handling for banned accounts
*   **How It Works**:
    - Each device generates a unique ID stored in localStorage
    - Backend checks if device ID already has an associated account
    - If duplicate detected: new account is banned, primary account receives warning
*   **Testing**: Device validation only works in production with real Telegram users (development mode bypasses device checks)
*   **Status**: ‚úÖ Fix verified by architect, ready for production testing
